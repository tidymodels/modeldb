\title{Visualize a KMeans Cluster with lots of data}
\usage{
plot_kmeans(df, x, y, resolution = 50, group = center)

db_calculate_squares(df, x, y, group, resolution = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A Local or remote data frame with results of KMeans clustering}

\item{x}{A numeric variable for the x axis}

\item{y}{A numeric variable for the y axis}

\item{resolution}{The number of squares in the grid. Defaults to 50.
Meaning a 50 x 50 grid.}

\item{group}{A discrete variable containing the grouping for the KMeans. It defaults to 'center'}
}
\description{
It uses 'ggplot2' to display the results of a KMeans routine. Instead
of a scatterplot, it uses a square grid that displays the concentration
of intersections per square.  The number of squares in the grid can
be customized for more or less fine grain.
}
\details{
For large result-sets in remote sources, downloading every intersection will
be a long running, costly operation.  The approach of this function is to
devide the x and y plane in a grid and have the remote source figure the
total number of intersections, returned as a single number.  This reduces the
granularity of the visualization, but it speeds up the results.
